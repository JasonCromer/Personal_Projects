 * <p>
 * A {@code Speechlet} is a speech-enabled web service that runs in the cloud. A {@code Speechlet}
 * receives and responds to speech initiated requests.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The methods in the {@code Speechlet} interface define:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>life-cycle events for the skill as experienced by the user</li>
 * <li>a way to service speech requests from the user</li>
 * <li>call-backs from events happening on the device the user is interacting with</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because a {@code Speechlet} is a cloud-based service, the life-cycle of the actual object
 * implementing the {@code Speechlet} interface is unrelated to the life-cycle of the Alexa skill as
 * experienced by the user interacting with the speech enabled device. A single {@code Speechlet}
 * object typically handles requests from many users, from many devices, for many sessions, using
 * many concurrent threads. Also, multiple requests that are part of a single session coming from a
 * single user and a single device may actually be serviced by different {@code Speechlet} objects
 * if your service is deployed on multiple machines and load-balanced. The {@link Session} object is
 * what defines a single run of a skill as experienced by a user.
