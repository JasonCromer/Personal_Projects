/**
 * <p>
 * A {@code Session} represents a single execution of a {@code Speechlet} by a user.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Multiple executions of a {@code Speechlet} are tied to separate {@code Session}s with different
 * identifiers. If the user explicitly exits the {@code Speechlet} and restarts it immediately
 * after, the new execution of the {@code Speechlet} will be associated with a new {@code Session},
 * regardless of how much time elapsed between the two runs.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code Session} is tied to the specific user registered to the device initiating the
 * {@code Speechlet} {@code Session}. A {@code Session} provides state that is maintained between
 * the multiple invocations of a {@code Speechlet}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The attributes of a {@code Session} are simple key-value pairs that are maintained between
 * invocations. You can use them to store lightweight data. They are comparable to session cookies
 * that you would use in a system where the client is a browser. Ending the session by closing the
 * browser would clear those cookies.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Attributes can be modified within a {@code Speechlet} invocation, but not after the
 * {@code Speechlet} method has returned. The modified attributes are sent back with the response
 * and kept for the next {@code Speechlet} invocation. The one exception is the
 * {@link Speechlet#onSessionEnded(SessionEndedRequest, Session)}, as the {@code Session} and its
 * attributes are discarded immediately after.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If the {@code Speechlet} throws a {@code SpeechletException}, modifications to the attributes up
 * to that point are applied, even if the request was not processed successfully.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Because a {@code Speechlet} is a cloud-based service, the life-cycle of the actual session object
 * passed in the {@code Speechlet} methods is unrelated to the Alexa skill execution as experienced
 * by the user interacting with the speech-enabled device. A {@code Speechlet} receives a new
 * {@code Session} instance for each {@code Speechlet} invocation. The identifier of the
 * {@code Session} is what uniquely identifies it between invocations. References to a
 * {@code Session} should never be stored as its contents is invalid after returning from a
 * {@code Speechlet} method.
 * </p>
