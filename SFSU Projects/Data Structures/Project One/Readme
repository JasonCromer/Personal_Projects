CSC220 Programming Project#1
============================
 
Due Date: 11:55pm, Sunday, 3/6, upload textfile SimpleFraction.java to ilearn

- You need to implement SimpleFraction class which is within package PJ1
  See PJ1/SimpleFraction.java and PJ1/SimpleFractionInterface.java for specifications

- Use PJ1_Test.java to test correctness of your proggram

- Compile programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):
	
  javac PJ1/*.java
  javac PJ1_Test.java

- Run programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  // Run tests in SimpleFraction class
  java PJ1.SimpleFraction	

  // Run main test program
  java PJ1_Test		

- Bonus (25%): Implement GUI test program
  
  Before implemeting GUI test program, 
  your program must work for all test cases using PJ1_Test.

  Talk to me before you start this part.
